# project

This is the repository for my Part III Project. It generates a summarized data for a setup consisting of an interferometer and spectrometer for the purpose of calibration later on. Currently have added parameters in config.json, need to add more sources of error.

# running the code

Execute as a module in a console. When prompted input either 'c' to generate another set of random exposures or 'b' to break the loop. Summarized data in 'data_1.npz'
