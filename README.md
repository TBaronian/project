# project

This is the repository for my Part III Project. 

It has a generator of observations (generator.py), model production using novel integration tecnique (model.py) and a basic Bayesian Optimization
routine in __main__.py.

# running the code 

Execute the code as the module. It is currently set to investigate parameter spaces of the objective function.
